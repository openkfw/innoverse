## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to NAMEXYZ , who is the current project maintainer.

## How to get started with InnoVerse

If this is your first time starting InnoVerse, you should follow the [StartUp Guide] for setting up the project.

## How to contribute

### Set up git hooks

At first, please run

`npm run prepare`

in the repository's root folder to set up our git hooks, which we use to enforce the [conventional commit message format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Start working on open issues

If you want to contribute, you can start by picking an issue from the [issue board]. You can assign it to yourself and start working on it.

### Create an issue or suggest a new feature

Noticed a bug or have some clear suggestions? Please feel free to open a new [github issue].
If you want to suggest a new feature simply open a new discussion in the [ideas channel]

### Open a Pull Request

When working on a feature, you can open a PR in as soon as you push the first changes. Please make sure you follow these guidelines regarding PRs:

- For external contributors: Make sure to open a new [fork] to our repository and then open a PR from that fork to this repository

- Make sure that the PR description clearly describes what you are working on
- If aplicable, mention what issue will be closed with this pull request, by typing `Closes #issueNumber`
- Describe how you are planning on implementing the soultion, maybe by creating a TODO list
- The PR should be in draft mode if you're still making some changes. If it is ready to be reviewed then mark it as "Ready for review"

### Creating a release

In order to create a release, follow the [release guide]

## How to ask for support

If you need to ask for support feel free to reach out to us on our [QA-Channel].

## Styleguides

### Git Commits

When writing commits you should consider the following guidelines:

- Write commit messages according to the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
- Follow these [git commit guidelines]
  - Add the appropriate prefix for the commit. Optionally add a scope. Allowed prefixes can be found in the [commit lint config](./commitlint.config.ts)
- When you're only changing the documentation you can include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

### Git Branches

When creating a new branch, you should consider the following guidelines regarding branch names:

- Lead with the number of the issue you are working on
- Add a short description of what the task is about
- Use hyphens as separators

Example:

- 213-your-issue

### Git Workflow

To get an idea about the workflow used in our project you should read this how to / git. So when working on a feature branch make sure to:

- Checkout the main branch and pull the recent changes

```sh
$ git checkout main
```

```sh
$ git pull
```

- Create a new feature branch respecting the guidelines mentioned above

```sh
$ git checkout -b 213-your-issue
```

- Try to keep the commits separate and respect the guidelines mentioned above. Don't squash the commits into a single one especially if you changed a lot of files
- Push to the remote repository and open a pull request respecting the guidelines mentioned above

```sh
$ git push origin
```

- Make sure the pipelines are passing
- Wait for a review. If you need a specific team member to review the PR you can request a review from them and assign them to the PR
- When your feature is ready make sure you have the latest changes by running $ git pull --rebase origin main on your feature branch and push the changes
- Merge the pull request into main
