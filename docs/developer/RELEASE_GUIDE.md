# InnoVerse Release guide

This guide descibribes how to create a new release of the InnoVerse platform.

To create a release

1. Create a branch for this release:

   `git checkout -b <branch_name>` e.g. `git checkout -b bump-to-1.5.0`

2. Bump the version, generate the release changelog and create a git tag with the following command:

   `pnpm run release`

   This bumps the version according to semver. Alternatively a specific version can be set using:

   `pnpm run release --release-as <release_version>`

   For more options, see the [commit and tag version github page](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#cli-usage)

3. Review the changelog and verify that all relevant package version updates are correctly listed.

4. Ensure that changelog entries are present for each significant change.

5. While commits with proper prefixes are automatically pulled from the main branch history, we typically add the corresponding PR link (in parentheses) instead of the raw commit hashâ€”for better readability and traceability.

6. Finalize the commit and push the changes **without** the newly created tag (we create the tag on GitHub later)

   ```bash
   git commit -m "chore(release): <release_version>"
   git push -u origin <branch_name>
   ```

7. Create a pull request
8. Wait for approval
9. Set the branch merge strategy to squash and merge (squashed commit message: `chore(release): <release_version>`)
10. Visit this [repository's release page](https://github.com/openkfw/innoverse/releases)
11. Create a new release

- Include the Changelog entry

- Create a new git tag pointing to correct commit on the main branch:
- Check the option "Create a discussion for this release" and select the category "Announcements"

## Configuration

Which commits should be part of the changelog and what headings are part of a releases's changelog can be configured in the [.versionrc.js](/.versionrc.js) file

## In-depth explanation

The command `pnpm run release` command does the following:

- Extract the versions stored in `app/package.json` and `strapi/package.json`
- Bump the version number up according to semantic versioning
- Write the new version number in the two `package.json` files from above
- Append the changes to the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Create a commit `chore(release): <version>`

The version bump and the changelog generation are based on the commits added since the last git tag. We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) in combination with the [commit-and-tag-version package](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version) to achieve this.
